## Update Checklist

1. Add a new row when a phase is defined.
2. Change the status emoji/text as work progresses:
   - ⏳ Planned → 🔨 In progress → ✅ Complete
   - Use ⚠️ if a phase is blocked.
3. Set “Last Updated” to the current date whenever you modify a row.
4. Briefly note major scope changes beneath the table if needed.

## Notes

- Phase numbering aligns with our high-level roadmap. If we insert new phases, append with `.a` / `.b` or renumber as needed.
- Keep detailed implementation notes in the relevant feature docs; this file is for high-level tracking.
